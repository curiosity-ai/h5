    // that builds are more reliable - it's not possible for artifacts from previous builds to exist). A compromise is to use "cleanOutputFolderBeforeBuildPattern": "*.js|*.css" so we can
    // let VS copy in other asset types, such as images, instead of us having to include EVERY additional image and other file in the resources list here).
